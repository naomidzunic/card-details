### What I learned

I chose this project as I knew it would likely be a skill I would need to know in the future, espeically when it came to working with businesses who use Shopify and Squarespace. While they offer pre-made stuff it never hurts to understand how to do it on your own. 

Building the form was simple (as I'm beginning to realize that I am relatively good at CSS). Using more Javascript is what I'm dipping my toes in. Little projects like this keep me motivated to continue learnning. 

One challenge I had while creating this project was the card images suprisingly. I started with adding them as background images in CSS but I couldn't figure out how to make them stationary while the screen size changed. Then that turned into an entire work around on adding images and aligning them, ensuring that all elements stayed centered. It took me a bit but I managed to do it (I'm sure this will bite me in the butt again later once I start adding the Javascript).

So later on, it actually isn't bitting me in the butt as much as I was anticipating. But as an extra challenge I decided to add a few things that weren't a part of the project: Verifying the credit card details (i.e. when the card is typed it will show whether it's a visa or mastercard or something else) and also spacing out the numbers to look like 0000 0000 0000 0000 so that it's easier on the eyes. I think replacing the numbers and names on the credit cards felt a little too easy so I'm taking on this extra challenge. And of course I'm searching on Google to find how I can learn to do this. I know this will be espeically helpful for when I'm building out pages for check out sites and whatnot so I've enjoyed this challenge so far. 

Once I finish with the Javascript portion of it I will then continue to the desktop portion since I know that designing is simple for me and it *shouldn't* take me as long but we'll see. That's what I said about mobile and yet it took me a while haha.
